## Run the code

- Compile first the cuDecomp library using *_lib.sh, the resulting modules and library will be located in cuDecomp/build/lib and cuDecomp/build/include
- Double check cuDecomp building is fine (must be compiled using HPC-SDK)
- Folder multi: contains the source-code of the multi GPU version of the code. Use local.sh, leo.sh or mn5.sh to compile and run the code; the multi GPU version relies on cuDecomp for pencils transpositions and halo exchanges.
- Autotuning of the multi-GPU version: Default pr=0 and pc=0 enables autotuging (when cuDecomp is initialized), cuDecomp will perform an autotuning at the start finding the best decomposition (the only input is the total number of tasks). In this way, everything is automatic and the code does not need to be recompiled when changing the number of MPI processes. Also backend is automatically defined.
- A conditional compilation flag is used to enable or not the phase-field module. By default is single-phase only.


## Reference performance

Performance (NS only)
* 256 x 256 x 256 | 4 x A100@Leonardo  |   16 ms/timestep
* 512 x 512 x 512 | 4 x A100@Leonardo  |  270 ms/timestep 
* 1024 x 1024 x 1024 | 32 x A100@Leonardo | 357 ms/timestep 
* 2048 x 2048 x 2048 | 128 x A100@Leonardo | 820 ms/timestep
* 256 x 256 x 256 | 4 x H100@MN5-ACC   |   13 ms/timestep
* 512 x 512 x 512 | 4 x H100@MN5-ACC   |  230 ms/timestep
* 1024 x 1024 x 1024 | 32 x H100@MN5-ACC  | 320 ms/timestep
* 2048 x 2048 x 2048 | 512 x H100@MN5-ACC  | 259 ms/timestep

Phase-field introduces about 15% of overhead compared to NS only.

## Scaling

Strong scaling results obtained on Leonardo (4 x A100 64 GB x node) and MN5 (4 x H100 40 GB x node)
* Tested from 1 node up to 128 nodes (Leonardo)
* Tested from 1 node up to 256 nodes (MN5-ACC)
* Grid from 64 x 64 x 64 up to 4096 x 4096 x 4096
* Very similar scaling for both NS and NS+ACDI
