# MHIT36_cuDecomp

Tentative porting of MHIT36 to multi GPU using cuDecomp.

Log of changes/status of the porting
- 06/02/25: MPI init in MHIT36 
- 07/02/25: Build of cuDecomp ok, present in cuDecomp-main/Build
- 11/02/25: Up to cuFFT plan, adding comments step by step 
- 12/02/25: Compile and run on Leonardo + makefile for Leo
- 13/02/25: Adaption to work with only one grid descriptor and pencils along y and z only (0,1,1). Everyhing seems fine
- 14/02/25: Pencil update on y and z look also fine and working, all basic elements seems to be ready. cuDecomp updated to (#52), version 0.4.2, Tested on Leonardo up to 16 nodes (with the makefile with -cuda + -Wl, relax). The makefile issue is present only on Leonardo where cuda is not present in the same folder.
- 15/02/25: General structure of the code inializated and division in substeps, rhsp and p as input and output for Poisson.
- 17/02/25: Cleaning and use of module.f90 and readinput.f90, more variable included in the modules. Temporal loop created. Soon merging with main repository?
- 18/02/25: Solvde issue on makefile and forced linking (working also in Leonardo)

# Run the code

- Compile first the cuDecomp library using *_lib.sh, the resulting modules and library will be located in cuDecomp/build/lib and cuDecomp/build/include
- Double check cuDecomp building is fine (must be compiled using HPC-SDK)
- Single folder: contains the single GPU version of the code (see MHIT36 repository for further details)
- Multi folder: multi GPU version of the code (work in progress). Use local.sh or leo.sh to compile and run the code (see porting status above); the multi GPU version relies on cuDecomp for Pencil Transposition and halo exchanges.
